# 🩸 Blood Donation Prediction

This project predicts whether a person is likely to donate blood based on historical donation behavior. It uses logistic regression and other machine learning models for binary classification.

## 📊 Dataset Features

- **Recency**: Months since last donation
- **Frequency**: Total number of donations
- **Monetary**: Total blood donated (in c.c.)
- **Time**: Months since first donation
- **Target**: Whether the person donated blood in March 2007

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧾 Files

- `blooddonor.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with EDA, modeling and evaluation
- `requirements.txt`: (Optional) Python dependencies for the project
